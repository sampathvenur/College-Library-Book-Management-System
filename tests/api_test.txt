Okay, let's run the application and test it using Postman. Here's what you should do after opening Postman:

**1. Create Collections (Optional but Recommended)**

* Create a new collection in Postman to organize your API requests. You can name it something like "Library Management System API."
* Within this collection, create requests for each API endpoint you want to test (e.g., "Get All Books," "Add Book," "Register User," "Login User," etc.).

**2. Make API Requests:**

* **Get All Books:**
    * Select the "Get All Books" request you created.
    * Set the HTTP Method to "GET."
    * In the "URL" field, enter the endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/books` (or the port you're using in your `app.js`).
    * Click "Send." 
    * Verify that the response status is 200 OK and that the response body contains an array of book objects.

* **Add a New Book:**
    * Select the "Add Book" request.
    * Set the HTTP Method to "POST."
    * In the "URL" field, enter the endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/books`
    * In the "Body" tab, select "raw" and choose "JSON" as the format.
    * Enter the following JSON data:

      ```json
      {
        "title": "The Lord of the Rings",
        "author": "J.R.R. Tolkien",
        "isbn": "9780261102354"
      }
      ```

    * Click "Send."
    * Verify that the response status is 201 Created and that the response body contains the newly created book object.

* **Get Book by ID:**
    * Select the "Get Book by ID" request.
    * Set the HTTP Method to "GET."
    * In the "URL" field, enter the endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/books/{id}` (replace `{id}` with the ID of the book you created).
    * Click "Send."
    * Verify that the response status is 200 OK and that the response body contains the details of the specified book.

* **Update Book:**
    * Select the "Update Book" request.
    * Set the HTTP Method to "PUT."
    * In the "URL" field, enter the endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/books/{id}` (replace `{id}` with the ID of the book you want to update).
    * In the "Body" tab, select "raw" and choose "JSON" as the format. 
    * Enter the updated book data in JSON format.
    * Click "Send."
    * Verify that the response status is 200 OK and that the response body contains the updated book object.

* **Delete Book:**
    * Select the "Delete Book" request.
    * Set the HTTP Method to "DELETE."
    * In the "URL" field, enter the endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/books/{id}` (replace `{id}` with the ID of the book you want to delete).
    * Click "Send."
    * Verify that the response status is 200 OK and that the response body contains a success message.

* **Register User:**
    * Select the "Register User" request.
    * Set the HTTP Method to "POST."
    * In the "URL" field, enter the endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/users/register`
    * In the "Body" tab, select "raw" and choose "JSON" as the format.
    * Enter the following JSON data:

      ```json
      {
        "username": "testuser",
        "password": "testpassword",
        "email": "testuser@example.com"
      }
      ```

    * Click "Send."
    * Verify that the response status is 201 Created and that the response body contains a success message or the user ID.

* **Login User:**
    * Select the "Login User" request.
    * Set the HTTP Method to "POST."
    * In the "URL" field, enter the endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/users/login`
    * In the "Body" tab, select "raw" and choose "JSON" as the format.
    * Enter the following JSON data:

      ```json
      {
        "username": "testuser",
        "password": "testpassword"
      }
      ```

    * Click "Send."
    * Verify that the response status is 200 OK and that the response body contains a success message or the user ID.

* **Get User Books:** 
    * Select the "Get User Books" request.
    * Set the HTTP Method to "GET."
    * In the "URL" field, enter the endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/users/{userId}/books` (replace `{userId}` with the ID of the registered user).
    * Click "Send."
    * Verify that the response status is 200 OK and that the response body contains an array of book IDs requested by the user.

* **Request Book:**
    * Select the "Request Book" request.
    * Set the HTTP Method to "POST."
    * In the "URL" field, enter the endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/users/{userId}/requestBook/{bookId}` (replace `{userId}` with the user ID and `{bookId}` with the ID of the book).
    * Click "Send."
    * Verify that the response status is 200 OK and that the response body contains a success message.

By following these steps, you can effectively test your Library Management System API using Postman. Remember to modify the JSON data and URLs as needed for your specific tests.
